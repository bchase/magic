steps
  [ ] fetch current CSV using an HTTP client
  [ ] loop through the data and parse values out of each row 
        (perhaps with: http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/String.html#method-i-split)
  [ ] create a `Card` class to hold said data (i.e. name, price)
  [ ] implement a method to look up a `Card` by name

  [ ] loop through a list of card names
    [ ] find the appropriate `Card`
    [ ] grab the card price
    [ ] add it to the card price total
  [ ] display the total
